# Code Guide

This Code Guide started off as as a copy of the excellent Code Guide by Mark Otto, but has been modified to suit my own purposes as a starting point for coding standards.

This version uses Prism for code highlighting, rather than YAML to keep things simpler.

Code Guide is a project for documenting standards for developing flexible, durable, and sustainable HTML and CSS.

### To Do

Fix tab spacing in code examples once we settle on a standard
Add SassyCss, BEM, or ITCSS conventions?

### Thanks

Heavily inspired by [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) and the [GitHub Styleguide](http://github.com/styleguide).

# Code Guide

This Code Guide started off as as a copy of the excellent Code Guide by Mark Otto, but has been modified to suit my own purposes as a starting point for coding standards.

Code Guide is a project for documenting standards for developing flexible, durable, and sustainable HTML and CSS.
